    <h1>Hi, I'm Mitesh</h1>
    <p>
        I am a backend developer with mediocre development skills that seem to stagnate rather than improve. 
        I've been unemployed for the past 6 months, and it feels like I've started and abandoned every project I've attempted. 
        My lack of focus and consistency has led me to drop ideas before they even have a chance to take shape. 
        I often find myself trapped in a cycle of procrastination, choosing the comfort of my couch over the discomfort of growth and productivity.

    <h1>I've been programming for the last 5 years</h1>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, my journey has been marked by inconsistency and a lack of dedication. 
        I only truly applied myself during my last job, but even that experience was marred by my inability to stay focused and committed. 
        I often succumbed to bad habits, like binge-watching shows instead of honing my skills or working on projects. 
        It’s disheartening to realize that despite the time I've spent in this field, I’ve made little progress and feel more lost than ever.

    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>
        <!-- Add your project details here -->
        I haven't managed to complete any projects, and it feels like I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of starting and failing. 
        Each new idea quickly loses its appeal, and I find myself abandoning them for the next fleeting distraction. 
        My love for comfort often wins over the drive to push through challenges, leaving me with nothing but half-finished concepts and a growing sense of regret.

<section id="contact">
    <h1>Contact Me</h1>
    <p>
        <!-- Add your contact information here -->
        If you want to reach out, you can try: <a href="mailto:mitesh96625@gmail.com">mitesh96625@gmail.com</a>. 
        But honestly, I’m not sure what good it will do. I’m in a rut, and I’m not sure how to climb out of it. 
        Perhaps it’s better to just let things be as they are.
